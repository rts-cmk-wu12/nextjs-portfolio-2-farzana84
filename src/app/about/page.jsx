          Im Amina, a creative front-end developer based in Denmark. With a
          strong foundation in media and communication from Roskilde Tekniske
          Skole, I enjoy combining visual design with technical skills to build
          websites that are both beautiful and functional. Im especially
          interested in front-end design and accessibility—making sure websites
          are inclusive, responsive, and easy to use for everyone.

          I enjoy working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and Ive been exploring
          tools like Figma, Adobe XD, and Webflow to push my design ideas
          further. For me, good web design is about storytelling. Whether its a
          portfolio, a product page, or a blog, I believe every site should tell
          a story clearly and visually.

          In my free time, I love drawing on my iPad (I use Procreate), reading
          graphic novels, and exploring languages and cultures through platforms
          like Duolingo and YouTube. I also have a soft spot for cozy games like{" "}
          <em>Stardew Valley</em> and <em>Spiritfarer</em>, which inspire me
          with their attention to detail and design.

          I see web development as a space where technology meets empathy—and
          thats exactly where I want to be. Im excited to keep learning, build
          meaningful projects, and grow in a direction where creativity and
          purpose go hand in hand.
